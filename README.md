# Wavelet-Toolbox-Wavelab_fast-
Wavelab_fast is a fast wavelet toolbox for one, two, and three dimensional signals. Wavelab_fast contains wavelet and undecimated wavelet transforms. Wavelet filters must be selected from wavelab toolbox by using MakeONFilter command or from Rice wavelet toolbox by using daubcqf command. Wavelab_fast is written based on modifying some codes from Wavelab and adding some codes for higher dimensional signals and implementing undecimated wavelet transform using algorithm a trous. The codes provided are much faster than the ones from wavelab for 2D and 3D signals. That has been done by skipping loops on pixels. ***The toolbox is recommended for applying on large 2D and 3D datasets. Also, in the case of having many 1D signals instead of using for loop.*** *** The code can only be used for academic purposes and the code must be cited by its DOI given by RG.*** *** For information please send an email to Behnood.rasti@gmail.com
